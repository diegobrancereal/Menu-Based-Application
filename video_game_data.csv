But with the DLC players can try out summoning giant flying robots with Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho.

For a story-driven FPS; Half-Life 2 is unique in its plot delivery; and making in-game mechanics feel natural; be it platforming or driving."

Hostile environments and one-hit deaths may seem difficult; but the game implements a fair amount of checkpoints. The monochrome color palette showcases cartoony proportions of every living thing while making lack of details threatening. Limbo shows you exactly what you encounter; but never how it looks.

Limbo uses the atmosphere and sound design of the horror genre while avoiding tropes of the modern horror games. The overarching theme and unique style compensated for the rather short game with an abrupt ending; making Limbo one of the most impactful games for the genre.

The simple controls and easy-to-pick-up mechanics help to make a clear distinction; which part of the stage players can interact with; and which part can lead to the quick death. Even though the game is in black and white; this separation is intuitive and natural; so the player would know exactly where to go or what to do."

Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus; a son determined to earn his respect; he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. 

From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests; mountains; and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore; this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures; monsters; and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration; the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. 

With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before; fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand; gritty; and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre"

You can beat the game without killing anyone making Mankind Divided a big morality question for the player as he walks it through."

Through environmental storytelling; notes; audio logs and even visions; players are invited to uncover the deep-rooted secrets of the castle. 
Throughout the game players will be introduced to the mechanics of Sanity; representing the mental state of Daniel which can be affected by lack of light; visions and even unpleasant encounters with the monsters. When decreased; Sanity will distort the vision of the player to a different and seemingly random effect; in order to depict actual effects of severe anxiety. Most of the game challenges are completed through the item search and physics puzzles; forcing players to be resourceful and courageous.
The game supports modding; and allows user-created content alongside the free DLC Justine; telling a story of a female prisoner. Given how short the DLC story is - several possible endings are available."

Action-adventure with horror elements; Alan Wake is paced like a thriller show; cinematic and slow; which is in alignment with the visual style of the rural region of Washington and linear storytelling. The main enemy; encountered by the players will be Taken – possessed by darkness creatures and humans that cannot be attacked outright; because they are shrouded in black smoke; blocking the attacks. Only after dispelling the darkness with a source of light players are able to affect the enemies. When the enemies are getting too close; Alan can perform a slow-motion dodge.
Two more episodes were published for the first game; called “The Signal” and “The Writer”; directly continuing the story of the main game; and completing the first season."
Half-Life 2: Deathmatch,2004-11-01,,Mature,1,Linux;macOS;PC,Action,Steam,Valve Software,https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ec3/ec3a7db7b8ab5a71aad622fe7c62632f.jpg,"Upon the release of Half-Life 2 players were greatly disappointed in one thing; and that’s the lack of multiplayer. Granted; single-player campaign of Half-Life 2 was impressive; but weapons that have been demonstrated in it made players curious. They questioned if the experience was complete because the first Half-Life included multiplayer mode from the beginning. Valve took the criticism and published Half-Life 2: Deathmatch – multiplayer only addition; based on the main game; which was a separate product; distributed on Steam. 
The game includes two major modes; which are Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Both modes have similar rules. Players must kill as many other players as possible; to gain points. Player or team with the most points win; and points are retracted for self-killing and team killing. Players can expect fast-paced matches with instant respawns."
Saints Row: The Third,2011-11-14,84,Mature,14,PC;Xbox One;Xbox 360;PlayStation 3;Linux,Action;Adventure,Xbox Store;PlayStation Store;Steam;Xbox 360 Store,Volition,https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d69/d69810315bd7e226ea2d21f9156af629.jpg,"Welcome to Steelport; a city that’s been torn by the three violent gangs.

And now; after a run-in with the corrupt police forces; when they’re in the hands of the Syndicate; alone and cut out from the gathered wealth and support; 3rd Street Saints have to start from the bottom. 
While being a third person action adventure game; Saints Row: the Third is described by developers as the game that has everything in it. While the base game is reminiscent of GTA type of games mechanically; shifting tone and frantic story create the comedic and exciting atmosphere. A long line of DLC adding to the game not only unique missions; even by the Saints Row standards; but customization items; transport; and outfits. Reviews adore the lack of serious tone and gritty realism."

Being a revolutionary at the time; we follow the story of Gordon Freeman - a silent scientist at the facility called Black Mesa. Arriving late at work and hastily doing his routine he runs into the experiment field. However; the experiment goes completely wrong and opens a portal to a completely different dimension called Xen. The laboratory is destroyed as well as the facility itself; as unknown creatures like Vortigaunts are now everywhere in the facility. Gordon must battle his way to the surface and find a way to close the portal.

One of the main features of Half-Life was story-telling through scripted sequences within the actual gameplay. Without having cutscenes; the game was able to tell the full story of the game by showing scripted deaths; dialogues; character appearance while the gameplay was moving one. By not ripping off the player from the process; the game feels much more smooth as it continues. Despite his science nature; Gordon is masterfully using his weapons and destroys any enemy at his path with rifles; grenades; shotguns and much more."

Randomly filled pre-set of locations; heavy grind and a possibility of replaying most of the areas leaves us with only one possible outcome. 

Players wake up on grim shores of Wraeclast. Without any knowledge who we are or what have we done; players must start to explore an aggressive and cruel fantasy world of criminals; bandits and murderers. Discover the mystery of a long forgotten the Eternal Empire; and survive.

Mechanics are pretty simple. Choose one of six different classes; gather gems for more skills to use and grind good and synergising equipment. Due to replaying; you can grind any needed equipment or resources to buy it from vendors. Infinite loop of gameplay will still be challenging. The cooperative mode allows beating the game with a party of friends up to six people at the same time."

The battle begins with players making the leap out of the plane to spread out across the map and to gather all possible equipment required for survival. Then; after a while; game intelligence randomly sets a circle shape safe zone; which gamers must reach to stay alive; and marks it on the map. Gear and resources are scattered throughout the map; so players can grab everything they need while running to the zone.

It is the earliest game in the Assassin's Creed universe chronology and the prequel to Assassin's Creed Origins.

###Plot
The events of Assassin's Creed Odyssey's take place in the Classical Era of Ancient Greece; in 431 BC; before the Brotherhood of Assassins was even formed. The plot follows a fictionalized story of the Peloponnesian War between city-states of Sparta and Athens that left Greece devastated. The player can choose to control either a male (named Alexios) or female (named Kassandra) protagonist; both of them being descendants of the famous Spartan king Leonidas. The player enters the plot as a mercenary and can side with either Athens or its rival Sparta. There's also the frame story set in the contemporary age. Its protagonist is Layla Hassan; who was also the main character in the frame story of Assassin's Creed Origins.

###Gameplay
Unlike most earlier installments of Assassin's Creed; which put the emphasis solely on action; Odyssey has a strong role-playing element in it. Dialogue options and the non-linear plot allow the player to reach several alternate endings. The game also has a reputation system and multiple options for romancing; including same-sex romances. The combat system is similar to that in Origins with the addition of new skills. The game also reintroduces naval battles."

A spin-off from the most popular open-world Early Access game on Steam ARK: Survival Evolved; ARK: Survival of the Fittest (SotF) pits up to 72 combatants in an action-packed struggle for survival where players are ultimately pushed into an epic final showdown where only one “Tribe” will make it out alive.

Survivors can form one- to six-person Tribes with the options to choose Unofficial and Official (Ranked) servers; and a variety of game-lengths and sizes in which to play.

Dedicated eSport ranking; matchmaking; reward; and tournament features make ARK: SotF readily accessible to all players.

Balanced for intense competition; contestants begin in a neutral staging area where they can communicate pre-game; strategize; or talk trash. After a count-down; they dramatically descend from the sky onto the ARK in a circular formation via beams of light. There is a cache of valuable items in the center – do survivors dash for the goods and fight it out; do they run into the forest and hide; search for Dinosaurs to rapidly build their army; or do they freeze up from the sheer terror of death? A continually shrinking “ring of death” forces contestants ever closer together over time. The hunt is on!

Destruction is at the head of the game mechanics. The surrounding objects are created with maximum realism; the degree of damage depends on the calibre of the bullets used by the players or on the total power of the laid explosives. Walls can be destroyed; creating new firing positions and shelters. Optimal use of the potential of destruction often becomes a guarantee of victory. Defenders can limit the ability of attackers to destroy; using kits to strengthen the walls and the device of some operatives.

The primary game mode - multiplayer; normal or rating. During the game in the last mode; the player is assigned a certain rank; and parameters such as the ratio of kills/deaths and wins/losses are recorded in his profile displayed in the game."

The overall visual style of the game is inspired by various science fiction books. Demoscene also served as a source of inspiration for the developers.

No Man's Sky gameplay implies the exploration of space and planets some of which are inhabited with extra-terrestrial life; gathering resources; space battles; maintaining and upgrading the player's ship and completing bounty hunting missions. The main objective is to reach the center of the galaxy. 

On release; it was stated that the game is in fact multiplayer; but the size of its world is so big that the probability of meeting another player is extremely small. It turned out that it is impossible to meet any other player due to the extremely limited multiplayer aspect. As of 2018; Hello Games released the fourth major update which included the full multiplayer experience."

Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land; and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive; dominate... and escape!
Dinosaurs; Creatures; & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process; involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious; and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed; you can issue commands to your tames; which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames; which can continue to level-up and consume food; can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor; carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength; and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains; lift allies over enemy walls; race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors; tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus; or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies; where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender; to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply; raise babies!
You must eat and drink to survive; with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties; including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water; long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower; and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment; causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter; and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors; to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!
By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources; you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts; including ramps; beams; pillars; windows; doors; gates; remote gates; trapdoors; water pipes; faucets; generators; wires and all manner of electrical devices; and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed; so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home; as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs; textual billboards; and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons; clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.
Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you; plant them in plots that you lay down; water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories; which can then be composted; and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits; which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish; and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!
By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations; you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures; who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames; and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.
Create a Tribe and add your friends to it; and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!
All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities; and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources; including the tallest mountains; darkest caves; and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions; Level-Up your tames; and learn new ""Engrams"" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints; even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair; eye; and skin tones; along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK; you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past; in the form of collectible detailed 3D ""Explorer Notes"". By uncovering all of these; you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK; and discover its purpose!
Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired; and when you leave the game; your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen; so to achieve security you must build-up; team-up; or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent; and you can even knock out; capture; and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes; such as extracting their blood to for transfusions; harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer; or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!
The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment; composed of many natural and unnatural structures; above-ground; below-ground; and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets; you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game; written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia; creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration; write custom points of interest onto it; and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players; whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat; or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.
On the 100+ player servers; your character; everything you built; and your tames; stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs; each slightly different than the previous; to leave your mark on and conquer; one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore; you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs'; for infinite replayability and endless surprises.
You can play single-player local games; and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers; back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game; with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!
The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4; with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination; weather systems (rain; fog; snow; etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation; and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

However; the plot of the fourth chapter is unique and has no direct references to the previous games of the series. The story is now set in the Far East; where the new main character Ajay Gale joins the opposition fighting the dictatorship. The open world lets players explore the entire environment of Kyrat – a tiny fictional region hidden in towering Himalayas. Ajay as a Kyrati-American travels to Kyrat to scatter the ashes of his mother in her motherland; but suddenly things go the wrong way; and he finds himself in the middle of the civil war between the powerful dictator Pagan Min and rebels from the Golden Path founded by his father. As the story progresses; players get new weaponry and equipment or customize the ones they have. From the very beginning; the whole map is not available; so to progress and to complete the story players have to open all the game areas by “activating” bell towers (traditional Far Cry mechanic) for establishing the Golden Path’s radio propaganda and defeating enemies’ fortresses.

The players will govern a house of nobility of that time; and ensure that its heritage will last for centuries. The second installment of the series fills the gap in the developer’s continuum of global strategies; allowing for lengthy grand campaigns and world conquests.
The main points of interest in the game are your noble house; holdings; and vassals. Players can engage in diplomacy between neighboring households; sign treaties and create a bloodline between two families; forge documents and declare wars. However; the primary competitive objective would not be conquering the world; but instead; winning the prestigious ranks and ensuring that your family will prosper.
Gameplay-wise; the mechanics revolve around interactions with your neighbors and your court. Buildings built; armies trained; but most importantly; your character should be built; too. Education; marriage; religion - everything will affect your lord-protege; and players often come up with different guides on how to achieve success without regards to the luck and skill of the player."

Successfully saving the kingdom; Amadeus seeks the fireball spells. Yet he is summoned to save the homeland with his friends - Zoya and Pontious. Goblins have taken over the land as they are trying to find the mysterious ""Witch"" deep in the forest. 

Although having more than one playable character; Trine successfully uses all three of them. Amadeus as the mage is able to move objects or create boxes and planks to help overcome some obstacles. Zoya is very agile so she can hook and grapple on some surfaces; or shoot different targets. Pontious is the strongest character in combat; and he can destroy walls in his path or deflect things with his shield. Having this three different characters; it is necessary to use all three of them to solve puzzles and beat the level. Not only you can play alone; but the game supports three players cooperative to make progress even more atmospheric. 

Beautiful design; music and a narrator makes Trine a great story; that feels inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien himself."

It is rather difficult to maintain a high level of games every year; but it worked out in the sixth part of the series. The game continues the storyline of the previous part.

The game consists of numerous fast-paced gunfights. Classic hit points are not here anymore - after receiving damage; the player only needs to sit tight in safety waiting for health to come back. There are three game modes: the story campaign; multiplayer and Spec Ops. 

If there are almost no changes in the campaign; and this is the same linear story; the Spec Ops includes 23 new levels for single or cooperative completion. Each level is a new task; a new challenge whether it is the defusing a bomb or the elimination of enemy forces. Levels are divided into tiers by their complexity.

As in any other game of the series; the multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 takes a special place. Each match is a mission; for which you need to come up with new strategies to complete. As in the past; new weapons and perks are opened for the execution of tasks."

In XCOM 2 we see the Earth under the rule of aliens. The order established by them is based on total control but is proclaimed as the realm of prosperity and security. However; on the periphery of large cities; there are those who consider it a dictatorship and are struggling to restore independence to people. Thus the new XCOM; the organisation of freedom fighters; is reborn. The base for the organisation's soldiers is now the alien ship ""The Avenger""; converted to the needs of the defenders of the Earth.
The player will have to travel around the global map; contact guerrillas in various places; look for resources and perform partisan attacks on the critical points of the enemies. The tactics of the organisation have changed - now they are in the minority. The factories for the production of weapons and other equipment were closed 20 years ago; so you have to collect any found equipment and resources.
The game introduced many new enemies; but there are aliens from the previous game too. The hero of the game has a unique ability to be in contact with the psi-network uniting all the aliens. This ability makes him a turning point in which the enslavement of the Earth can be reversed."

During the new installment; the player is set to make way through the American Revolution; while being on both side of a conflict — our hero has English father and Mohawk mother; which tears him apart. Such conflicts serve as the leitmotif through the entirety of a game — not only we are choosing sides to fight on in the Civil War; but also we are facing the decisions of choosing Assassins' or Templar's side.
As it is common in the Assasin's Creed games; the gameplay concentrates profoundly around fighting the multiple enemies all at once; parkouring off walls and micro-management: selling resources; exchanging ships and so on. The Assassin's Creed III; however; highlights the hunting and simultaneous use of two weapons as the new in-game features."

The game reproduces this work - but scammers and unusual situations occur in it much more often than in reality. The task of the player-officer is not to make a mistake; not to let an unwanted guest into the country. He has power; directories; translucent devices; etc.; but experienced masters of deception and fraud act against him. The task of the player is complicated by the fact that his country is like all the paranoid dictatorships at the same time. This country fears a lot; seeks to control everything and periodically generates various rules. The game has a lot of humour; a lot of exciting puzzles and unexpected twists; including shooting. The visual and musical design of the game reflects the bizarre world of stupid rules; constant fear and mutual distrust.

The gameplay resembles the same arena shooter mechanics as the previous installments. For the first time in the series; the so-called champions appear in the game. Each champion has a different amount of health; top speed and a unique ability that can be used once in 20-45 seconds depending on the champion and needs to be recharged after usage. The abilities are designed using the rock-paper-scissors principle with each ability serving as a counter to another. This was done in order to put emphasis on a player's skill and not the chosen character. The game also features character customization system which allows changing the look of any selected champion.

There is no loadout system in the game whatsoever. Players have to pick up the weapons scattered on the map.

Players can download the game for free; yet they will have access to only one Champion; Ranger. The players have to either rent new champions using the in-game currency or by the so-called champions pack that will unlock every in-game character for an unlimited amount of time."

Also; there is a variety of game modes to choose from. In Free Fro All the player with most points wins the game when everyone battles everyone in this massacre mode. Duel makes a tournament - one vs one fights of knights where only better skill or luck will grant you victory. Team Deathmatch is a traditional mode with two teams and scores that must be reduced to zero in order to win. 

What is not so ordinary for the genre; however; is a first-person camera. You are able to control any movement of your weapon thus creating a unique pattern of your attacks and slicing through enemies in order to win."

All the traditional victory types are in place; and a new one; religious; is introduced.

A distinct new feature in the sixth part is that city improvements are no more concentrated in each city's only main tile. Instead; they are distributed throughout its whole surrounding area. Each of them is now considered a ""district"" with a specific purpose; and some of them should be built only on specific terrain. Similarly; wonders now occupy tiles on their own. Technology tree was also modified to take into account the player's terrain improvements that may speed up the research of certain technologies. Cultural achievements; such as Opera or Drama; are no more considered ""technologies"" and form a separate Civics research tree instead. Also; unlike most of its predecessors; Civilization VI allows stacking similar types of military units."

The frame story; told in cutscenes; begins in 1910; in Kansas; where Silas; a patron in the pub; brags about his adventures in the Wild West. This old man claims he used to be a bounty hunter who took down many of the famous outlaws. Most of the game has the player re-enacting Silas's presumed past; while in the present the hero is narrating his own story off-screen. Silas is an unreliable narrator; however; and his own in-game audience will point at plot holes in his tall tales. 

Like the rest of Call of Juarez games; Gunslinger has every classic staple of the western genre. There are saloons and gold mines; stagecoaches; Indians and cowboys; sheriffs and gangs. The protagonist will escape prison; wander the Wild West; fight brigands and other enemies using a variety of late XIX century firearms; and occasionally sing country songs. Gunfights and duels are the central features of the game. There's even a Duel mode; in which the player can enter a tournament of gun duels; and the Arcade mode; in which multiple opponents attack the player. Gunslinger also introduces quick time events that allow the player to evade bullets."

The gameplay is very reminiscent of older side-scrolling beat-em-up titles. It can be summarized as a player has to defeat waves of enemies in different locations using his weapons and magical abilities. However; it also incorporates some role-playing elements such as acquiring gaining new levels which allow a player to enhance his stats and acquire new moves. One of the gameplay’s focal points is cooperative multiplayer with the support for up to 4 players which is available both locally and online.

###Story
Not much story is present in the game; as only bits of any information are given out to the players. The game takes place at a remote island; where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak; yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal; as; in case of death; his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner's body; and gets back to the game's starting area. 

###Gameplay
The game's heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac; as stated by the developers.

Dead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games; yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.

The players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island; they find various loot; fight dangerous creatures; collect armor; abilities; and power-ups. Upon death; the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. 

The game uses death as a learning experience; as it randomizes the placement of enemies; so the players can't take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves."

When creating a character; first select a class - Soldier; Scoundrel or Scout. Classes differ in the proportion of strength; health and cunning. Later; three more classes will open; each of which will be a Jedi: Jedi Guardian; Jedi Consular; and Jedi Sentinel. This will also be the choice in favour of different proportions of strength; intelligence and skills.
In the world of ""Star Wars;"" there is a Force that can be vested both by the Jedi and by their enemies. There are Force Powers of three types: light; dark and neutral. They should be studied; this raises the level of skill. Forces are expended but are restored.
The player can alternately lean toward both the Light and the Dark Side of the Force - this will affect the ending of the game and the use of Force Powers. For example; if the character belongs to the Light Side; then the use of the Dark Force will require more of this Force from him than using the Light.
The hero will visit the underground metropolis; the desert planet; the planet-forest and the planet-ocean; caves with crystals for light swords; sand Tatooine; the planet-cemetery; space ships and stations.
The hero will interact with sentient beings; droids of different classes and exotic animals."

The game’s protagonist is Isaac; a child from a religious family. His misadventures are based off a biblical story about a character of the same name; although the gameplay itself certainly does not follow the same footsteps. There are also additional; unlockable characters with unique abilities and traits; which will affect your playthrough’s difficulty. 
The Binding of Isaac featured non-linear levels; which brought about different outcomes of the game. Depending on the character played; playstyles can also differ; allowing players to create and share new metals for further replayability; and eventual full completion of the game."
Resident Evil 4 (2005),2005-01-11,83,Mature,5,GameCube;Android;iOS;PlayStation 2;Wii;PC,Action;Shooter;Adventure,Google Play;PlayStation Store;App Store;Steam,Capcom;Capcom U.S.A;Capcom Production Studio 4,https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fee/fee0100afd87b52bfbd33e26689fa26c.jpg,"Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series; it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy; who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president's daughter Ashley Graham; who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe; Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite; and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.
Development began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments; the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.
Resident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five; but was ported to numerous formats; becoming a cross-platform hit; selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative; gameplay; voice acting; and characters; and is often named one of the best video games; winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres; popularizing the ""over-the-shoulder"" third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.

#Gameplay
The player controls the protagonist; Leon S. Kennedy; from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games; the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon; or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead; every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight; up; or down; players have more options. For example; shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble; and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.
Resident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation; players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder; jumping out of a window; dodging an attack or executing a ""finishing move"" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events; in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights; in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.
The main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (""The Cattle"" in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge; wield melee and projectile weapons; and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.
The inventory system features a grid system; represented by an attaché case; that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times; allowing for more space. Weapons; ammunition; and healing items are kept in the case; while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays; weapons; allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.
Capcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version; which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is ""Separate Ways""; a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker. ""Ada's Report""; a five-part documentary; analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames ""The Mercenaries"" and ""Assignment Ada"" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples); new costumes for Leon and Ashley; new weapons; and a cutscene browser.

#Plot
U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence); the U.S. President's daughter; who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain; where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados; the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.
While in the village; Leon is captured by its chief; Bitores Mendez; and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano); a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape; but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough); leader of Los Illuminados; reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a ""sample"" once she returns home; allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.
After killing Mendez; Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica); another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle; and the two become separated by Salazar's traps. Meanwhile; Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley's infection; as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler; who takes the sample; while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands. While in the castle; Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill); a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.
Afterward; Leon travels to a nearby island research facility; where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades; Jack Krauser (Jim Ward); who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior; is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh); for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions; Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon; believing that no matter which one dies; he will benefit. After Krauser's fatal defeat; Leon rescues Ashley; and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler; and with Ada's help; manages to kill him. However; Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter; leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes."

This is the first game in the series not developed by Capcom; but rather by English studio Team Ninja. Concerning story; the game is connected to the previous game and changes the cast of characters and even Dante’s (the series main protagonist) iconic appearance (which was met with indignation from the series fans at the time). The game’s story is notable for its social commentary regarding mass-media and modern capitalism drawbacks.  
The gameplay overall is very similar to the other installments of the Devil May Cry series and is heavily focused on fast-paced fighting with hordes of demons with occasional puzzles and platforming sections. The main change in the game’s combat mechanics is the Angel and Devil modes. They alternate Dante’s and attacks and special abilities. The modes are activated by holding left or right trigger (on the controller) which makes switching between them instant and allows performing complex combos; combining each mode’s unique features."

Players are offered to join the protagonist’s space adventures to complete his main mission and to force a Necromorph outbreak. As in the previous part; Isaac uses a special Resource Integration Gear – special suit; which displays important in-game parameters including health and oxygen level (required for vacuum spaces); and which also serves as a gameplay HUD. In case if one of the scales reaches the zero point; Isaac will die; and the game will be restarted from the last checkpoint.

The game has a ""Detective mode"" - the skeletons of enemies are highlighted; it is possible to conduct various examinations; for example; tracking the flight of a sniper's bullet. There is also access to a database that tracks villains in the city.
At a certain point in the story; you can play as a Catwoman. She has an analogue of ""Detective Mode"" - ""Mode of the thief"".
The visual decision and soundtrack are very atmospheric; soft; but give a clear sense of gloom and horror; entirely in the spirit of the plot and characters."

By exploring the ocean; finding the remnants of other crashes; and listening to the radio messages; Robinson will learn about the enormous Leviathan; the mysterious Precursors; and the reason why this planet is quarantined.
The game is famous for its spectacular portrayal of the ocean and its wildlife. Robinson is equipped with a scuba diving gear that allows the player to spend most of the game underwater; although oxygen still has to be replenished. The player can dive deep and explore the world full of corals; fish; and other colorful sea creatures; often grotesque or bio-luminescent.

The game setting is the same as the one in the original game: the story takes place in the science laboratory called Black Mesa Research Facility in New Mexico. However; the game portrays the events of Half-Life through the eyes of Barney Calhoun a security guard employed by Black Mesa. Till the things have gone the wrong way the protagonist was responsible for the lab equipment and personnel welfare; but after the accident; his only aim is to protect a high-ranked scientist Dr. Rosenberg. The gameplay is almost similar to the original Half-Life’s: the storyline continues by navigating through the sequence of levels. Each level consists of both combat part and solving puzzles. Although Blue Shift is an expansion to the original Half-Life; both weaponry and enemies range face no changes or additions; so players use same guns to shoot same aliens. The only new mechanics is escorting a character to a specific location.

Nevertheless; shooting scientists is not required; as the main threat comes out of aliens. The overall gameplay has few differences comparing to the one existing in Half-life; as far as it is based on completing the sequence of levels. Although the combat system looks almost the same; it features the non-player character’s assistance so the protagonist will receive support from scientists; security guards; and marines (soldiers; combat medics; and engineers) during firefights or while solving puzzles. Players will also face new aliens types added to the existing ones.

As an Overseer; you have to control the essential aspects of life in the Vault; especially: energy; food; water and the number of inhabitants. Your task is to develop and expand your shelter; as well as to fight enemies; to resist the attacks of raiders and other representatives of the Wasteland. 

To obtain resources; you need to assign people to the appropriate premises; properly distributing their skills between strength; perception; endurance; charisma; intelligence; agility and luck. Each character characteristic will affect how well he produces a particular type of resources and how high his chances to survive in the Wasteland. 

An essential aspect of the game is the correct use of resources and their balance. And with a deficit of one; there are difficulties. For example; the lack of electricity disrupts the premises; the lack of water leads to radiation exposure of residents; and food — to the loss of health. You also need to protect themselves from attacks by raiders; mutated rats;  ghouls and other creatures."

The game develops between three points in the biography of the girl Jodie Holmes. In these three points; we find ourselves repeatedly. And in general; we see 16 years of her life; from 8 to 24 years.
Jodie from birth has a gift of communication with a disembodied being called Aiden. In this context; the Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people's consciousness; move objects; and even strangle people. At the same time; Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies.
Her parents are not her relatives; they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes; Jodie; with the help of Ayden; establishes a connection with the deceased; she can let the living and the dead speak.
The CIA is interested in Jodie's abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions; but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone; and she destroys them.
The game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead; different people use Jodi's forces in different ways. Jody herself also does not have a clear picture; she seeks and finds real parents; helps different people - but they rarely pay her the same."

For example; a mission in which it is necessary to steal weapons technology from an enemy planet - to execute it; you need to knock out as many brains as possible from giant flying octopuses. Why? Because these brains can exchange the necessary technology from one local scientist; who needs brains for the experiments; but the boss does not give it to him.
The gameplay consists of destroying enemies in a variety of unexpected ways; with weapons of fourteen kinds; and among them a shotgun that turns enemies into pixel pictures and then crushes them into pixels. There are a lot of such finds in the game. In addition to shooting; there are chases and other things. And besides weapons - a lot of useful original devices."

In the corporate equation for the colony; you are the unplanned variable.

Key Features
The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition; how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build; companion stories; and end game scenarios.

You can be flawed; in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds; the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures; but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.

Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony; you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities; these companions all have their own missions; motivations; and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals; or turn them to your own ends.

Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony’s two planets didn’t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship; build your crew; and explore the settlements; space stations; and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon."

American Nightmare’s gameplay is very similar to that of the original game; however; this time it is much more action-oriented; rather than story-driven.

The squad of criminals searching for another “big score” is set up against easy-to-manipulate civilians and powerful police forces; so players are to try their best to prevent the alarm signals and not to face armed resistance. However; if the heavy combat begins; the best option will be to keep shooting countless enemies down till the money is in the bag and the heist is over.

Each level is a kitchen; and your goal is to cook a list of meals following the onscreen recipes. The time is limited; and there are restrictions on how much money the player can spend on the ingredients. The player controls two characters that can be switched at any time or ordered to do a list of actions. 
The kitchens are often set in the oddball places; such as a pirate ship; two speeding trucks; a pedestrian crosswalk; or an iceberg. The level elements are dynamic and may move or change during the gameplay. Tables and ovens can slide; and the cooks can fall off the level; though they will respawn shortly. 
There’s a story mode in which cooking is tied to the plot. The game is set in the Onion Kingdom that was attacked by an insatiable spaghetti monster. The chefs travel back in time to refine their cooking skills and feed the monster when it appears again.
Since even in the single mode the player has to control two cooks; the game predictably has a co-op multiplayer and a competitive mode in which the players try to “outcook” each other. Both modes; however; are local; and there’s no online multiplayer."

Batman himself does not use any weapons due to his moral choices while the enemies grow stronger and begin using different weaponry as the game progresses.

In some cases; while confronting a group of enemies; it is suggested that Batman's actions should not be spotted and the game turns into a stealth action."

The game is full of gross violence; black humor; obscenities; and biting satire of American life. The plot follows Postal Dude; a typical ""white trash"" and a small town trailer-park dweller; as he is given menial daily tasks; such as buying milk. The way he completes them; however; is what makes Postal 2 one of the most censored and offensive games ever. At the various points of the game; the player may piss over his opponents; use cats as gun silencers (by literally showing your gun up the cat's anus); burn dogs alive; blow up cars (but not drive them; in Postal 2 cars are simply four-wheeled explosives); shoot people and flip them a bird. The game; however; is just as violent as the player wants it to be. Most missions can be accomplished without killing; though it would have spoiled all the fun.
The gameplay has changed since the previous part. Isometric view from the original was replaced with the first-person view. The world around Postal Dude is living by itself; regardless of the player’s presence; much like in Grand Theft Auto series. All the town inhabitants are programmed to walk; chat and even fight each other as if they were real people."

Sometimes some helicopters shoot everyone on the ground. Fortunately; helicopters can be brought down.
Weapons can be found; collected and improved. Sophisticated and more effective weapons sometimes cannot be assembled independently; you need to use drawings and find rare details; sometimes leaving very far.
Sometimes planes drop from the sky ""parcels"" with various useful staff. The falling parcel is visible from afar; the path to its fall can be long. The package can be noticed by others. A long road can be facilitated by a vehicle. For example; a boat."

In the story mode; called Wintermute; you control a pilot; Will Mackenzie; who was hired by his ex-wife Astrid to deliver a mysterious cargo. Eventually; his plane crashed in the woods. Will is injured; and Astrid is missing; presumably lost somewhere in the wilderness. Your goal is to survive and to rescue your companion.

This is the most popular mode; in which you are not confined to the plot and can discover new areas."

Leader’s tactical skills face challenges; frequently questioning morality and the basic foundation of what we consider an organized society.

But there is a clarification - this is a dead policeman; killed because of his work; but he did not leave the world; he turned into a ghost and did not lose his passion for investigations.
A hero can do many things in our world; but not all. Can be present everywhere and even pass through the walls (but not in closed houses; only through open doors and windows). Can see what ordinary people see; read; think. But he can not take and move things; cannot talk with living people - for actions with objects and communication he has to find a girl-medium.
In the game; you need to collect evidence and draw conclusions from this. Ways to extract proof are sometimes very exotic. For example; a hero can penetrate the memory of a witness and find there information that the witness himself cannot remember. The hero can meet other ghosts; who were once people and killed - after talking with them; you can learn about the circumstances of this.
Finding evidence and reasoning is not the only thing that you have to do. The hero can be killed a second time; and it will be definitive - some disembodied beings seek to destroy the hero's soul. But they are vulnerable; and the hero can kill them."

Quests help to find the information about the in-game universe and races and lead through different tasks. Some levels are based on platforming only; while the others make you change the environment and solve puzzles. Some of them are based on the character’s ability to turn into a ball and use both hands to hold tools.
And still; the key feature of Starbound is procedurally generated levels and their design. The game features a huge amount of planets to explore; with multiple caves; buildings; labyrinths; and forests."

She has to start a battle for herself - for the self that she does not even remember.
Setting; plot; design and lighting immediately evokes a masterpiece of cyberpunk - «Blade Runner». But the game is noticeably superior to the movie regarding «volume» of space; the sensation of «air» and «presence» in the game. There is an impression that you see the world of the game 360 ​​degrees around you. Mimicry and plastic of characters are directed in each detail; undoubtedly dramatic; give a full impression of a play of live actors. It seems that even the movements of inanimate objects are filled with the same expressiveness - for example; the trajectories of a thrown pistol or splinters ... High level of directing and corresponding levels of design and graphics. A mass of significant finds; filling every frame with emotion and senses."

The players have a certain time limit as they have to advance further the river before the rains catch up with them. 

The game features a crafting system; hence why it is important to look for various objects in the game world. A complicated wound treatment system is also present in the game as players have to know how to treat a snake bite or hypothermia. 

The developers put a strong emphasis on procedural generation used in the game. Anything from the river itself to every AI encounter is generated on-the-go. Fear; hunger; and aggression affect the NPCs behavior.

Resembling a roguelike genre; the death in-game is permanent to some degree. You will have to start from the head of the river but you are able to save some of your items using your faithful dog."

Protagonists and antagonists have unusual abilities or conventional abilities; developed to an unusually high level. This is manifested; among other things; in the possession of ghostly forms; by which it is possible to mislead other people.

The game is strictly from the first person. A notable feature of the gameplay is the slow motion mode. In this mode; the player accelerates the perception to such an extent that it can see the flying bullets. This gives him obvious advantages. The slow motion mode; in the game; is explained by the increased content of adrenaline in the blood; which occurs in a person; in a situation that threatens life. If this condition is caused in a natural way; then it does not last long. It can be extended with the help of a special drug; which is included in the number of useful game stuff.

This game offers an arcade physics that focus players on their positive emotions. Even the advanced damage system is only a cosmetic feature because damages don’t really affect car running performance. Everything in the game is made for the spectacle.

The player takes a role of one of four characters on the Belgian; American; French and German side of the Great War conflict — World War I. During the game they need to solve puzzles; watch animated cutscenes; fight enemies and do military races.

Players complete races and fill the “driving license” scale to upgrade the level and to open new cars and events. The free roam mode itself is also an integral part of the gameplay: while traveling across the map drivers are able to perform various stunts and unlock special achievements for the “license” experience.
